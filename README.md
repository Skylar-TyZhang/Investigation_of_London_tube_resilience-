# Investigation_of_London_tube_resilience-
This is for the assessment of module CASA0002 Urban Simulation. The project covers the following two parts:
The resilience of London tube was invetigated through network measurements of effect from node removal.
The simulation of commuting flows was explored with differnet spatial interaction models.
Note: a proportion of codes in this project was adapted from the tutorial from the module.
